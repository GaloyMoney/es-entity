# fn delete

If you are using Event Sourcing we assume you believe in immutability and keeping a long term audit history.
Deleting data from the Database goes against these principles.
Therefore `es-entity` does not provide a way to actually delete data.
It is however possible to configure a soft delete option by marking `delete = soft` on the `EsRepo`.

This will omit entities that have been flagged as deleted from all queries as well as generate additional queries that can include the deleted entities:
```rust,ignore
fn find_by_<column>_include_deleted
fn maybe_find_by_<column>_include_deleted
fn list_by_<column>_include_deleted
fn list_for_<column>_by_<cursor>_include_deleted
```

As a prerequisite the `index` table must include a `deleted` column:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  -- deleted will be set to 'TRUE' when `delete` is called.
  deleted BOOL DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
);
```
